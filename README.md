# Anime Quote Generator with Vue
A simple anime quote generator being build in Vue.js for educational purposes. 
First time trying out Vue, decided to go with something simple to see how everything works.

## The goal
Create a working random anime quote generator and get familiar with Vue in the process.

## Progress:
- [x] Setup basic project files
- [x] Create all components
- [x] Fetch data (log in console)
- [x] Show data on page
- [x] Styling (sort of, room for improvement down the line)

### Thoughts on this project qnd Vue:

#### This project:
Seems like a fun little project. Have learned a bit here and there about vue andworking with frameworks.

#### Tailwind
Tailwind seems like a really powerful utility-first CSS framework

#### Vue:
Setup is easy with CLI, different options during installation.
Nice way of writing within the <script> tags in a component. 
Easy creation of components and placing them in others.
Props are fun (once I kinda got the hang of it)

#### Rsources used:
- Vue V3 Docs
- Youtube
